These include **RcNursEstDate** which has 83 missing values, \"**Ganaura**\" with a substantial 2,417 missing values, \"**CropOrgFYM**\" with 2,674 missing values, and \"**TransplantingIrrigationPowerSource**\" with 503 missing values.

For example, the \"CultLand\" column shows a great diversity in the areas of cultivated land, with an average area of about 28.53 acres and a substantial standard deviation of 30.45. A similar pattern can be seen in the \"CropCultLand\" column, which has a standard deviation of 27.99 and an average of roughly 24.73 acres. These figures point to a broad range of land sizes in the dataset that are utilized for crop cultivation. The \"SeedlingsPerPit\" column displays a rather high standard deviation of 7.62 and an average of 2.71, suggesting some fluctuation in the number of seedlings planted per pit. Additional numerical factors, such \"BasalDAP,\" \"StandingWater,\" and \"TransplantingIrrigationHours,\" and \"Yield,\" which show comparable patterns of variability and offer insightful information about farming methods and crop results.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Test

For example, the \"CultLand\" column shows a wide diversity in the areas of cultivated land, with an average of approximately 29.20 acres and a significant standard deviation of 24.65. A similar pattern can be seen in the \"CropCultLand\" column, which has a standard deviation of 23.29 and an average of roughly 25.54 acres, indicating a broad range of land sizes in the dataset used for crop cultivation. The \"SeedlingsPerPit\" column displays some variability, with an average of approximately 2.60 seedlings planted per pit and a standard deviation of 2.05, indicating fluctuations in planting practices. Additional numerical variables, such as \"BasalDAP,\" \"StandingWater,\" and \"TransplantingIrrigationHours,\" exhibit similar patterns of variability and offer valuable insights into farming practices and crop outcomes.\n","\n","- The variable '**Yield**' is present in the training dataset but not in the test dataset. This indicates that 'Yield' is the target or dependent variable that we want to predict."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"M1cox4McUNC7","outputId":"2e2753c9-2877-4354-a34d-d4e1e4540dbf"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>ID</th>\n","      <th>Yield</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>ID_F9XXEXN2ADR2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>ID_SO3VW2X4QO93</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>ID_UKUQ7JM8E894</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>ID_QUISMWEZR2H4</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>ID_25JGI455VKCZ</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                ID  Yield\n","0  ID_F9XXEXN2ADR2      0\n","1  ID_SO3VW2X4QO93      0\n","2  ID_UKUQ7JM8E894      0\n","3  ID_QUISMWEZR2H4      0\n","4  ID_25JGI455VKCZ      0"]},"execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["sample_submission.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jZ2BE29rR0Xs","outputId":"d83ae4a9-3af8-433b-a338-f18c2b7cf5be"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["393.8160470653371"]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Split data for training and local testing\n","\n","X = train.drop(['ID', 'Yield'], axis = 1)\n","X =X.select_dtypes(include=np.number)\n","y = train.Yield\n","\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 1234)\n","\n","# Instantiate model\n","model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state = 1234)\n","\n","# Fit model\n","model.fit(X_train.fillna(0), y_train)\n","\n","# Make predictions\n","preds = model.predict(X_test.fillna(0))\n","\n","# Measure model performance\n","mean_squared_error(y_test, preds, squared=False)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"wpL7M1GWR0Vp","outputId":"4ad5c2e2-dccb-4873-c09c-17d3f436c7f3"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>ID</th>\n","      <th>Yield</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>ID_F9XXEXN2ADR2</td>\n","      <td>671.40</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>ID_SO3VW2X4QO93</td>\n","      <td>417.09</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>ID_UKUQ7JM8E894</td>\n","      <td>493.95</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>ID_QUISMWEZR2H4</td>\n","      <td>328.80</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>ID_25JGI455VKCZ</td>\n","      <td>537.19</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                ID   Yield\n","0  ID_F9XXEXN2ADR2  671.40\n","1  ID_SO3VW2X4QO93  417.09\n","2  ID_UKUQ7JM8E894  493.95\n","3  ID_QUISMWEZR2H4  328.80\n","4  ID_25JGI455VKCZ  537.19"]},"execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Make predictions on the Zindi test set\n","test_df = test[X.columns]\n","preds = model.predict(test_df.fillna(0))\n","\n","# Create submisiion file to be uploaded to Zindi for scoring\n","sub = pd.DataFrame({'ID': test.ID, 'Yield': preds})\n","sub.to_csv('BenchmarkSubmission.csv', index = False)\n","\n","sub.head()"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
